# PY-PetFax
We have been asked by a local animal shelter to create an application that shares fun animal facts alongside photos of the animals available for adoption. They hope this will be a fun way to get potential adoptees to engage with the shelter and find the animals loving new homes.

They just want us to create a proof of concept so let's use this opportunity and use a whole new stack to build the application. We will use Python and Flask, and no database for this initial sample.
